                    <p class="p4">Hi, I am Jude Joshua. I am currently working on sharpening my design skillset to foster my use of creativity and passion for design, to change the way the world works.
                        <br/>From 2014 until starting an internship in 2017, I have gathered experience in website design, website development, and (recently) in product design technologies. This knowledge has helped me collaborate with business owners,
                        startups, and private individuals to design and build systems that give users a better digital experience.
                        <br/>My mission is to create digital spaces and communities which will serve; not only serve as systems for better user experience but will also train other budding designers on how to build empathy-based systems that will allow
                        end users the comfort of their digital experience.</p>
