This is because a lot of users are already used to a particular way of life/lifestlye. However, what always pushes through, is how much of a solution a digital platform has to offer.<br/>
                            And this is what I have done; spent years building and learning how to design what works and what gives users satisfaction.<br/><br/>

                            There is always a driving force that pushes one to excellence or otherwise. For me, I'm driven by a deep passion for design. Not a single day has gone by without me engaging my design skills in some way.<br/>
                            Like Samadara Ginige, an award winning logo designer and developer once said, "<span id="quote">Design is everywhere. From the dress youâ€™re wearing to the smartphone youâ€™re holding, itâ€™s design</span>". I have had a love for design and arts from my childhood. This, combined with an interest to make life better and easy for people, are what pushed me to develop my skills in design.<br/>
                            And whether it is through design or coding, I always seek to make the digital life of my users as easy as I can make it.</p>
