                                Creating user-friendly systems doesn't just happen. It calls for some skills applied through different processes.

                            There is always a driving force that pushes one to excellence or otherwise. Me, I'm driven by a deep passion for design.<br/>
                            Many designs today have the beauty, luxury, and ease of a workable platform. But they often fail to consider one critical point - development feasibility. That is one of the key challenges developers experience when working with product designers.</br>
                            <!--A lot of work goes in from the design stage to the development stage. Most times, there are a lot of design changes that must take place during development to accommodate code functionality.-->To this end, developers make various design-code changes which usually results in a loss of style. I know this because I have been opportune to experience both sides of the web world as a web designer & developer and then a product designer.<br/>
                            My ability to leverage this problem and provide a design that works in functionality and experience makes me different from the rest. I do this by providing a design system that respects the laws of coding and development. It is not prone to numerous developer alterations and balances the end users' needs and the business objectives.
                            <!--There is always a driving force that pushes one to excellence or otherwise. Me, I'm driven by a deep passion for design. A single day doesn't go by without me engaging my design skills with some task.</br>-->

                            <!--I have loved design and arts since my childhood. And combining this love with a zeal to make life better and easy for people is what pushed me to develop my skills in design. And whether it is through design or coding, I always seek to make the digital life of my users as easy as I can make it.-->
