                                I currently work part-time as the lead product designer with the team at FirstMedtrade Africa to build an improved medical lifestyle for easy, accessible and affordable healthcare for Nigerians. I also share my knowledge and design expertise with students as a mentor on DesignLab, providing support and guidance to them on their design journey.<br/><br/>
                                My focus is on creating end-to-end user-friendly experiences for businesses that are minimal, accessible and useful in a way that helps them relate to their users and provide the right solutions.

                            My favourite thing to do is to have a good laugh. I like to write, listen to music, play board games, and spend some alone time reading. I also enjoy being around my family and my loved ones.<br/>
                            P.S. You could also find me playing with the neighbor's dog üòÅ.<br/><br/>
                            So, whether it is through talking, listening or coaching, I always try to make experiences better for others.

                                In 2013, I completed a six-month training course on Microsoft Office Tools and web design terminologies. During this time, I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, I became interested in web design and began taking more tests and replicating some designs online.<br/><br/>
                                In 2017, I interned as a Web Designer at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria. My ability to quickly learn their existing systems and stay current with new technologies led me to be placed in charge of a team responsible for executing a three-month training program for 10 senior staff and 50 newbies.<br/><br/>
                                My expertise allows me to work with business owners, startups and individuals to help them build their solutions with a stress-free experience for their users.
