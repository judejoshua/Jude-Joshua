                            I am currently working as the lead product designer with the team at First Medtrade Africa to build an improved medical lifestyle for easy, accessible and affordable healthcare for Nigerians.<br/><br/>
                            Outside of this, I focus on creating intuitive and user-friendly experiences for small and medium-sized businesses. My goal is to create minimal, accessible and useful designs that help businesses relate to their target audience and provide them with the right solutions.<br/><br/>
                            A favourite thing about myself would be that I love to have a good laugh. In my spare time, you’ll find me writing, gaming or spending time with my loved ones. I have a knack for always trying to make things better for others, so you might also find me tinkering with solutions for people’s lifestyle problems either through talking, listening or coding.

                                I began my tech journey in 2013 after I concluded a six months training in Microsoft Office Tools and Web design terminologies. Here, I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. From there, I picked up little web design tests and tried replicating some designs I found on the web to hone my skills. In 2017, I interned at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria as a Web Designer. Having the ability to quickly learn and understand most of their existing systems, I was added to a team that was responsible for planning and carrying out a training program for 1000+ tech newbies.<br/><br/>My expertise allows me to work with business owners, startups and individuals to help them build their solutions with a stress-free experience for their users.
