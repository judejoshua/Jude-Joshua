                    <p class="p4">
                        In the past three years, I have been working with the team at First Medtrade Africa, Nigeria, to build an improved medical lifestyle for easy and accessible healthcare to Nigerians.
                        I began my tech journey in 2013 when I concluded a six months training in Microsoft Office Tools and Web design terminologies. Here, I learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript. And after this, I picked up little web development tests and tried replicating some designs I found on the web to hone my skills. In 2017, I got an internship as a web developer intern in Akwa Ibom state's ministry. Because I was quick to learn and understand most of their existing systems, I was able to help the team in planning and carrying out a training program for tech newbies.
                        <br/>
                        I have a vast experience in web design/development and product design technologies. With my expertise, I have worked hand-in-hand with business owners, startups, and individuals to bring their ideas to life with a stress-free experience for their users.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Everyday, I am working on sharpening my design skills to foster my creativity and passion for design and change the way the world works.
                        <br/>
                        My mission is to use my knowledge to create digital spaces and communities that will serve as systems for a better user experience.

                                When I’m not coding nor designing, I write. Writing is among one of the things I enjoy doing aside from designing. It's like an escape route that takes me into another world of creativity. I write short stories, poems, and sometimes self-care articles.
